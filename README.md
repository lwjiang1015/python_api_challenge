## Part 1: WeatherPy

Following the starter code, generated more than 500 cities (593) nearest to the randomly generated longitude and latitude.

Guided by the starter code, retrieved the weather data including temperature, himidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. 

Created a DataFrame to hold the data and export the DataFrame to a csv file for later use.

Created scatter plots to show the relationship between latitude and temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed, respectively.

Created linear regression upon the scatter plots for the above relationships for northern and southern hemispheres seperately. Total 8 scatter plots and linear regression created. 

## Part 2: VationPy

Following the starter code, load the DataFrame generated from WeatherPy.

Created a map that displayed a point for each city in the DataFrame (map 2, total 593 cities).

Following the suggested criteria, narrow down the DataFrame to 13 cities.

Created a new DataFrame to store the nearest hotel name within 1000 metres of the coordinates.

Added the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map (map 2).
